People Survey","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey/versions/2","description":"# Introduction\n\nIn 2013, students of the Statistics class at [FSEV\nUK](https://fses.uniba.sk/en/) were asked to invite their friends to\nparticipate in this survey.\n\n* The data file (\u0060responses.csv\u0060) consists of 1010 rows and 150 columns (139\ninteger and 11 categorical).\n* For convenience, the original variable names were shortened in the\ndata file. See the \u0060columns.csv\u0060 file if you want to match the data with the original names.\n* The data contain missing values.\n* The survey was presented to participants in both electronic and written form.\n* The original questionnaire was in Slovak language and was later translated\ninto English.\n* All participants were of Slovakian nationality, aged between 15-30.\n\nThe variables can be split into the following groups:\n\n* **Music preferences** (19 items)\n* **Movie preferences** (12 items)\n* **Hobbies \u0026 interests** (32 items)\n* **Phobias** (10 items)\n* **Health habits** (3 items)\n* **Personality traits, views on life, \u0026 opinions** (57 items)\n* **Spending habits** (7 items)\n* **Demographics** (10 items)\n\n# Research questions\n\nMany different techniques can be used to answer many questions, e.g.\n\n* **Clustering:** Given the music preferences, do people make up\nany clusters of similar behavior?\n* **Hypothesis testing:** Do women fear certain phenomena\nsignificantly more than men? Do the left handed people have different\ninterests than right handed?\n* **Predictive modeling:** Can we predict spending habits of a person\nfrom his/her interests and movie or music preferences?\n* **Dimension reduction:** Can we describe a large number of human\ninterests by a smaller number of latent concepts?\n* **Correlation analysis:** Are there any connections between music and\nmovie preferences?\n* **Visualization:** How to effectively visualize a lot of variables\nin order to gain some meaningful insights from the data?\n* **(Multivariate) Outlier detection:** Small number of participants often cheats and randomly answers the questions. Can you identify them? Hint: [Local outlier factor][1] may help.\n* **Missing values analysis:** Are there any patterns in missing responses? What is the optimal way of imputing the values in surveys?\n* **Recommendations:** If some of user\u0027s interests are known, can we predict the other? Or, if we know what a person listen, can we predict which kind of movies he/she might like?\n\n# Past research\n\n* (in slovak) Sleziak, P. - Sabo, M.: Gender differences in the prevalence of specific phobias.
